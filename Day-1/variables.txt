in python, as it is dynamically typed PL.
here we dont need to write Datatype of variable which we do in c,c++,java..

here just as soon as you assign any value to variable, variable is created and memory get allocated.
for ex.
 
 marks = 98
 name = "Aditya" etc
 flag =True    no need to tell datatype of value to variable explicitly...
