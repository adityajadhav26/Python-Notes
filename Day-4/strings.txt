Strings in python:

python don't have 2 separate data type for charcater and strings that java have.
Also python allows indexing on string value, but java dont allow indexing on string.

in python, anything (alphanumeric and symbloas )enclosed in single/ double quotes is a string (text) data type.

    str1 = "this is string"
    str 2= 'this is also a valid string value '
    str3 = "this home is Aditya's home.. "
    str4 = "abc123$%#sdf13"

Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
'hello' is the same as "hello".


You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes:
    a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
    consectetur adipiscing elit,
    sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
    ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."""
    print(a)

    a = ''' Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
    consectetur adipiscing elit,
    sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
    ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.'''
    print(a)    

--------------------------------------
Strings in Python are not arrays, but they behave similarly — they’re sequences.
	•	They are immutable (just like in Java).
    .   Use list(str) if you want a mutable version of the string.
Strings support indexing, slicing, iteration — so they feel like arrays but are more powerful and safer.
